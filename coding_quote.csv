0,"One of the problems we've had is that the ICT curriculum in the past has been written for a subject that is changing all the time. I think that what we should have is computer science in the future - and how it fits in to the curriculum is something we need to be talking to scientists, to experts in coding and to young people about.",Michael Gove,Science Future Time People
1,"Many jobs at Google require math, computing, and coding skills, so if your good grades truly reflect skills in those areas that you can apply, it would be an advantage. But Google has its eyes on much more.",Thomas Friedman,Eyes Good You More
2,"In a web/mobile startup, coding is not an outsourced activity. It's an integral part of the company's DNA.",Steve Blank,DNA Company Activity Coding

4,"I wouldn't want everybody to be an art or literature major, but the world would be poorer - figuratively, anyway - if we were all coding software or running companies. We also want musicians to awaken our souls, writers to lead us into fictional lands, and philosophers to help us exercise our minds and engage the world.",Nicholas Kristof,Art World Exercise Musicians
5,"Computers add convenience to our everyday lives, but we are limited in what we can do with technology others have imagined. The ability for humans to teach machines entirely new things - coding - is nothing short of a superpower.",Tobias Lutke,Technology New Nothing Computers
6,"Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life.",Reshma Saujani,Life Success You Failure
7,"In the '80s, society created a caricature of what a hacker or a programmer looked like: a guy wearing a hoodie, drinking energy drinks, sitting in a basement somewhere coding. Today, programmers look like the men we see in the show 'Silicon Valley' on HBO. If you look at the message girls are getting, it's saying, 'This is not for you.'",Reshma Saujani,Today You Society Look
8,I was full of pride when President Obama talked about coding in his last State of the Union address. I was proud when Chicago recently made computer science mandatory as a requirement for graduation. To see this elevate to the level of a bigger conversation is progress.,Reshma Saujani,Science Proud Progress Conversation
9,Computer science is not just for smart 'nerds' in hoodies coding in basements. Coding is extremely creative and is an integral part of almost every industry.,Reshma Saujani,Science Smart Creative Just
10,"Girls Who Code doesn't exist solely to discover the next great female technology icon, although that would be great! In addition to coding, the girls at our program learn to pitch ideas and products, present themselves professionally, and interact with colleagues at every level of a company.",Reshma Saujani,Great Technology Colleagues Next
11,"Coding - everyone thinks it's a superpower. And so when you feel like, 'I've learned how to code,' and you say to your mom or the girl sitting next to you, 'I know how that app is built, I know the logic behind how that was created' - that's powerful.",Reshma Saujani,You Girl Feel Next
12,"Out of grad school, I worked as a tech writer for a while before going into computer coding for a living.",Richard Powers,School Living Out Going

14,"Under the leadership of President Obama and a whole host of partners, including nonprofits, foundations, and advocates, the Department of Labor has made historic investments in community colleges, apprenticeships, coding boot camps, and summer jobs.",Tom Perez,Leadership Community Summer President
15,"APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation of coding bums.",Edsger Dijkstra,Future Mistake Past Perfection
16,"Like Netflix, Looker started as nothing more than an idea. Lloyd Tabb and Ben Porterfield were two brilliant engineers who had figured out a better way for businesses to see and analyze their data, and they asked me to join them to help out with the ABCs - that's short for Anything But Coding.",Marc Randolph,Me Better Netflix Nothing
17,"Problem-solving, inventing, hacking and coding is more of an adrenaline rush of endorphins rather than a feeling.",Walter O'Brien,Feeling More Hacking Adrenaline
18,"The word 'code' turns out to be a really important word for my book, 'The Information.' The genetic code is just one example. We talk now about coders, coding. Computer guys are coders. The stuff they write is code.",James Gleick,Book Important Information Talk
19,"The cells of an organism are nodes in a richly interwoven communications network, transmitting and receiving, coding and decoding. Evolution itself embodies an ongoing exchange of information between organism and environment.",James Gleick,Information Evolution Environment
20,"Whether you draw diagrams that generate code or you type at a browser, you are coding.",Kent Beck,You Coding Whether Type
21,"Coding is like writing, and we live in a time of the new industrial revolution. What's happened is that maybe everybody knows how to use computers, like they know how to read, but they don't know how to write.",Susan Wojcicki,Time New Live Computers
22,"The balance of evidence both from the cell-free system and from the study of mutation, suggests that this does not occur at random, and that triplets coding the same amino acid may well be rather similar.",Francis Crick,Random May Balance Well
23,"One of the first major programming projects that I worked on when I was growing up in Ireland, back just coding by myself, was a programming language. Then I spent a bunch of time working on a new web framer. Just back-end things to make it easier to go in and build things on top of, do other development.",Patrick Collison,Myself Time New Go
24,Programs like ACE's Bootstrap Summer Camp teach our kids important computer coding skills that will allow them to design their own futures.,Gina Raimondo,Will Important Design Like
